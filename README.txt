This was originally intended as a mock-up for my wife's future website.  She is an architect, and I wanted to practice a few ideas.

I worked on:

- grid
- animations
- navbar
- designing and creating a vector graphic
- background blend mode
- pseudo elements

This is, I believe, the first project where I focused on organizing my code into easy-to-manage and navigatable sections.  I have a sweet spot for organization and categorization, so clean code comes naturally to me.  Since this project, I've become better at using modifier classes and building both my HTML and my CSS in more well-defined sections.  I've also gotten much more proficient with writing reusable code.  I love that once the index page is fully built, the supplimental pages are so much easier to piece together as long as the code was written with proper forethought.

I am also quite pleased with the design elements of this page.  The color scheme is one of my personal favorites, and I'm proud of the word placement and the background image styling of the hero area in particular.  I think the font, colors, and spacing turned out well for my first foray into design.
